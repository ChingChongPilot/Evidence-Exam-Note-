\section*{General Reflection}

\subsection*{Key Principle}
Probably the most important thing in evidence law is that evidence needs to be 

Evidence law focuses on the issue of relevance. Relevance, in this context, determines whether the evidence directly responds to or supports the arguments presented by counsel or the prosecutor. The key question is whether the evidence is probative in relation to the legal arguments being made.

Probably one of the most important things in evidence law is that evidence needs to be about the fact. Therefore opinions are usually not admissible. The evidence needs to help jury to determine the fact. 

The materials used in arguments are either prejudicial or probative. To ensure a fair trial, the court excludes prejudicial materials while retaining probative materials as evidence. Therefore, most rules that govern evidence admission are designed to protect the fairness of the trial.  

The probative evidence refers to evidence that has the ability to prove or disprove a fact in issue in a legal proceeding. The probative value of evidence is assessed based on its tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.

Therefore, the key principle is the evidence needs to be relevant and probative to be admitted. 

\subsection*{Type of Evidence}
There are two types of evidence: real evidence and documentary evidence. Real evidence consists of physical objects or events presented directly in the courtroom. Documentary evidence, on the other hand, includes written or recorded materials and is generally classified as hearsay, making it inadmissible under common law unless an exception applies. To admit documentary evidence, specific exceptions must be met, such as an affidavit in a civil case.
